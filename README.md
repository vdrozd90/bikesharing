### Overview
This is an analysis of the New York City bike sharing program. The analysis will be used to help investors decide if a bike sharing program could work in Des Moines. 

### Results

Below are the results of the New York bikesharing program form the month of August:

As we can see in the chart below, Males made up a majority of the riders for the month of August. 65% of the riders are males, compared to only 25% of the riders were female.

Peak hours in August were 5-6pm and 8am, this is in line with the typical commute hours for individuals working 9-5 jobs. The below 2 charts will be helpful to determine what time and which days maintenance can occur.

The below 4 charts offer us greater insight into who the users are. We can observe overall the trip durations, we then dive deeper to show trip duration for each gender. Lastly we observe the habits of the riders, the charts offer us insight into which days and times the bikesharing is the busiest. Our last chart concludes with showing information of Subscribers vs customers.

### Summary

At this time more research is needed before applying this bikesharing program in Des Moines. New York is the busiest city in the US full of tourists and locals, the 2 cities are not comparable and thus should not be treated in the same manor. Two additional visualizations that can be run are creating an age breakdown, and creating a Age by Weekday chart.
